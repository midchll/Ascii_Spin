## Ascii_Spin

### Mostly standard reversable b/w image to ascii conversion that's voxelized, layered on z-axis, and rotated around y for a spinning 3D object effect.
#### I created this as a proof of concept for my ideal stylized masthead for a future project.
#### Some test images are included but globals must be updated as main.py is the 'entry point'. Upon running, frames are exported to ascii_frames.json and can be iterated and printed to the DOM. View index.html in browser to see effect.
